# Rehearsal — Practice for the real world

This repository contains everything you need to explore **Rehearsal** locally or online.

## 🌐 Quick Online Demo

No setup needed! Check out the app in AI Studio:  
[View the app](https://ai.studio/apps/drive/1bYwj6YmPOZI7s2Ob3RkLfMfZsmx1lYC4)  
You’ll need a Google Maps Platform API key for that.
If you got confused like me, it will lead you to the page anyway.
