# Rehearsal ‚Äî Practice for the real world

This repository contains everything you need to explore **Rehearsal** locally or online.

---

## üåê Quick Online Demo

No setup needed! Check out the app in AI Studio:  
[View the app](https://ai.studio/apps/drive/1bYwj6YmPOZI7s2Ob3RkLfMfZsmx1lYC4)  
You‚Äôll need a Google Maps Platform API key for that.
If you got confused like me, it will lead you to the page anyway.

## üíª Run Locally

Want to play with it on your own machine? Follow these steps:

**Prerequisites:**  Node.js


1. Install dependencies:
   `npm install`
2. Set the `GEMINI_API_KEY` in [.env.local](.env.local) to your Gemini API key
3. Run the app:
   `npm run dev`
And you still need a Google Maps Platform API key.
